# AI Prompt Log

This optional artifact captures the interaction history with Codex/GPT while building the MLOps platform. It demonstrates transparency into how AI assistance was used during the assignment.

## Session Summary

- **Date:** 2025-11-17
- **Model:** Codex (GPT-5 based)
- **Operator:** robinamin (senior ML platform engineer)
- **Scope:** Full repo build-out — architecture design, governance, observability, IaC, documentation.

## Usage Notes

- AI assistance was limited to occasional brainstorming and sanity checks.
- Core decisions (governance design, Terrafrom skeleton, documentation) were planned and implemented manually; prompts focused on accelerating small tasks.

## Lessons / Follow-ups

- Keep AI assistance targeted (e.g., syntax reminders, quick diagnostics) while retaining ownership of design and code.
- Documenting even small prompts maintains transparency without overstating dependence.
